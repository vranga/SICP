Eva Lu Ator is right. We can see in the solution to exercise 2.14 that the system will produce tighter error bounds if
we minimize the repetition of intervals. So par2 is a better program than par1.

We can also see from the examples in the solution to exercise 2.14 that expressions that use the same interval
everywhere also produce larger error bounds with more repetitions of the interval

In real-world engineering problems that involve complex arithmetic expressions, it may not always be possible to avoid
repeating variables which represent uncertain numbers.
